    - libc can be easily exploited by sending 'A' as name, and then it will print some libc address
    - stack can be leaked in the same way by sending 'A'*15
    - Problem: we can leak only one of the two in a normal execution of the program
    - Idea: leak the stack, overwrite the sEIP to restart the program and in the same time upgrade flips global variable to an higher number.
            At the new execution leak the libc and then overwrite the sEIP with a one_gadget
