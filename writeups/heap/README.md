# Heap Exploration

This set of challenges is about Heap Exploration. The goal is to understand how the heap works and how to exploit it.

I used [How2Heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap) as a reference for the challenges.

Challenges (in rough order of subjective difficulty):

- [fastbin_attack](./fastbin_attack/)
- [playground](./playground/)
- [pkm](./pkm/)
