## User Registration and Login

Pretty standard

## Create Note

Possible vuln: if note length is higher than 0x10001 the note is freed but NOT the inner owner name, memory leak

## Fill Note

Possible vuln: strings are not \0 terminated if the entire length is written -> memory leak

## Print Note

Possible vuln: it's possible to print not filled note

## Delete Note

Possible vuln: maybe an arbitrary free???
