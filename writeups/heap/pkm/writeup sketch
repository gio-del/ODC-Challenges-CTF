- In get_string there is a malloc of a given size and then a single NULL byte overflow, interesting!
- Each pkm has a list of move, each move containes a name string and a function pointer

High Level Idea: use this NULL byte poisoning vulnerability to allocate two overlapping chunks, and then overwriting the function pointer to go to system for example.

We also need a leak of libc?
